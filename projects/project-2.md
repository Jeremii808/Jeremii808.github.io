Seicho is a mobile app that I helped create for CS 460 (Software Engineering I) and CS 461 (Software Engineering II). This was a year-long capstone project that was brought to us by Professor of Japanese Language at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, Yoshiko Okuyama. Professor Okuyama has proposed to our team to create a mobile game that teaches teens and young adults who have hearing disabilities about the Japanese language. It was requested that the game should be enjoyable to play to the point where users would want to continue playing the app. In this way, the users will be able to play an addicting game while also learning about the various aspects of the Japanese language.The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Seicho is heavily implemented in C# and utilizes a Monogame framework.

In this project I gained experience with backend mobile app programming and associated technologies, including MS Azure for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
